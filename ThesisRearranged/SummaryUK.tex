\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis follows the development of a StarCraft: Brood War agent, and explores the challenges which real-time strategy game poses artificial intelligence. It presents simple but efficient solutions to the most important problems. The agent is capable of efficient resource gathering, training and building units and expanding to more bases. Troops are grouped, retreating when outnumbered and attacking when not. Using a Protoss rush strategy, the agent performs very well in the Student StarCraft Artificial Intelligence Tournament, netting an 79.23\% win-rate on average across 700+ matches.
