\chapter{StarCraft}
\emph{StarCraft} is a \emph{real-time strategy} game released by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. Players take the role as one of three different factions, the \emph{Terran}, \emph{Zerg} or \emph{Protoss}. Controlling structures and troops, they seek to expand their economy, technology and army until they can eliminate all opponents. The expansion \emph{StarCraft: Brood War}, also released in 1998, increased the rooster of units available among other things.

In the multiplayer mode, players start with a single resource depot structure and a few worker units. They must from there destroy all the opponents' structures. The matches happen on an array of different \emph{maps}. Players must deal with imperfect map information as their visibility is limited to their units and their immediate surroundings - the rest is shrouded in the \emph{fog-of-war}. With a large amount of different units and buildings available, the players compete by adapting strategies to counter their opponents. There is no perfect strategy capable of winning every game, as the decision space is nigh infinite.
