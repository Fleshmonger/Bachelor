\chapter{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence in \emph{real-time strategy} (RTS) games offer the challenge of limitless decision space, incomplete world information and varied strategies in a shifting \emph{metagame}. A computer controlled player, called a \emph{bot}, must both be efficient and effective. Compared to other games, RTS focuses on a single agent.

StarCraft: Brood War, released by Blizzard in 1998, is one such RTS game that has been the focus of research. In addition to usual RTS elements, StarCraft is asymmetric with three different factions to play as and slightly asymmetric maps. Since the advent of the unofficial \emph{Brood War API} (BWAPI), people have been able to develop their own bots for the game, pitting them against each other and spawning a few tournaments. The tournament scene is still maintained even though both the game and API have become dated.

This project will both focus on creating a competitive bot by following successful contemporary bots, and investigate how prevailing bots are designed and how they overcome the aforementioned challenges. The bot will be spar against other bots in the SSCAI (Student StarCraft AI) tournament, possibly competing in the 2015 tournament (depending on when it starts).
