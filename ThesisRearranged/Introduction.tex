\chapter{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence in \emph{real-time strategy} (RTS) games offer the challenge of limitless decision space, incomplete world information and varied strategies in a shifting meta-game. A computer-controlled player, also called a \emph{bot}, must both be efficient and effective.

StarCraft: Brood War, released by Blizzard in 1998, is one such RTS game that has been the focus of research. In addition to usual RTS elements, StarCraft is asymmetric with three different factions to play as and slightly asymmetric maps. Since the advent of the unofficial \emph{Brood War API} (BWAPI), people have been able to develop their own bots for the game, pitting them against each other and spawning a few tournaments. The tournament scene is still maintained even though both the game and API have become dated.

This project will both focus on creating a competitive bot by following successful contemporary bots, and investigate how prevailing bots are designed and how they overcome the aforementioned challenges.

Chapter \ref{ch:process} explains the project process. Chapter \ref{ch:starcraft} briefly covers the basics of RTS games and StarCraft for those unfamiliar with the franchise. Chapter \ref{
