\chapter{Conclusion}
The agent has been a success with a $79.23\%$ win-rate in mixed-division on SSCAIT, playing Protoss rush strategy. It is contesting a few others for the top score in the student-division. The agent is capable of efficient resource gathering across multiple bases, managing production and executing an early rush strategy. It can complete build-orders, such as an early-expansion opening. The agent gathers troops before attacking the opponent, and retreats when outnumbered. It uses a simple heuristic to predict combat outcomes in determining its tactical choices. The project has met its goals of a competitive bot for StarCraft.

The bot will be submitted to the 2015 AIIDE, CIG and SCAIIT competitions and further development is planned at least until the competition deadlines.
