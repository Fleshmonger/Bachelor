\chapter{Conclusion}
The bot has been a success with a $79.23\%$ win-rate as Protoss in mixed-division on SSCAIT. It handles basic StarCraft maneuvers such as harvesting both types of resources on multiple bases, building structures and executing a simple rush strategy. It can execute build-orders, including early expansions. When in combat, it can do basic tactical decisions such as gathering troops and retreating. With a very simple but somewhat effective combat prediction heuristic, it will attack only when ready. The project has achieved its goals of developing a competitive bot for StarCraft. While the bot is simple compared to humans and older bots, it is still above in complexity and effectiveness than the average.

The bot will be submitted to the 2015 AIIDE, CIG and SCAIIT competitions and further development is planned at least until the competition deadlines.
