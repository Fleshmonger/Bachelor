\chapter{Preface}
This thesis was prepared at DTU Compute in fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring an B.Sc. in Engineering.

Starcraft is one of the strongest game franchise ever created. Professional players compete in Starcraft 2 tournaments with large price purses. Perhaps less known is that former developers of Othello and chess playing programs have taken on the task to develop AIs for the game. Most developers use the relatively old Starcraft Brood War as all the necessary infrastructure is readily available: \url{http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/}. Championships for AIs, bots, are arranged yearly, see for example \url{http://www.sscaitournament.com/} and \url{http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~cdavid/starcraftaicomp/}. In addition, ladder systems are also available, see \url{http://bots-stats.krasi0.com/}.

The project focuses on developing a new bot and is aimed at 20 ECTS.

The project involves:
\begin{itemize}
	\item studying and implementing AI methods for handling large search spaces.
	\item developing high-level strategy reasoning algorithms and heuristics.
	\item solving unstructured optimization problems.
\end{itemize}
